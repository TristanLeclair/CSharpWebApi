# A GET only Web API for my Notion Dungeons & Dragons campaign database

A C# project I'm working on to work on my .NET skills a little bit.
If I keep working on it, it could eventually become a huge API but I'm going to keep it relatively contained for now.
May or may not create a frontend for it (maybe try out Svelte or work on my React skills)

## Installation

# REST API

## Gods

`GET /api/`

curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:7238
